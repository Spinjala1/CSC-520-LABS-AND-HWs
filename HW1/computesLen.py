** H1 - Explain why your code shows that computesLen is undecidable.
The provided solution demonstrates that `ComputesLen` is undecidable by transforming the 
problem into one that requires solving the Halting Problem. In `alterYesToLen`, we create 
a modified program string that incorporates the original program and checks if it computes 
the length of a given input. By executing the original program within this modified context 
and testing if the output matches the expected length, we simulate the behavior needed to 
determine if the original program computes the length of its input. `yesViaLen` then uses 
the `ComputesLen` oracle to check if this modified program correctly computes the length 
of its input. This reduction shows that if `ComputesLen` were decidable, we could decide 
the Halting Problem, which is known to be undecidable. Hence, `ComputesLen` must also be 
undecidable.
